This repository demonstrates a common mistake in Dockerfiles: using `ubuntu:latest` and insecure COPY commands.  The original Dockerfile uses `ubuntu:latest` which is bad practice because it can change unexpectedly leading to build inconsistencies.  It also copies the entire project context, which is both insecure and inefficient.  The fixed Dockerfile addresses these issues by specifying a version for Ubuntu, using a specific Python version, and only copying necessary files.  It also adds a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from the context.
